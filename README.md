# UI Design Helper Module

This repository contains two Python files used for a basic unit testing assignment:

### `design_tools.py`
Provides simple UI-related utility functions:
- `is_text_fit(text)`: Checks whether the text length is 15 characters or less.
- `calculate_padding(screen_size)`: Returns responsive padding values based on screen size.

### `design_tools_test.py`
Includes unit tests (using Python's `unittest` module) to verify:
- Correct behavior of the text length validation function.
- Correct padding values for mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

This repository is used as part of a university assignment on writing and running unit tests in Python.
